# Task Master API

## Summary
We build a REST API using Node, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Nodemailer for task management software, covering authentication and task management features.

## Highlights
- 🚀 **Project Setup**: Initiate a TypeScript project using Node and Express.
- 🔒 **Authentication**: Implement user signup and login with JWT for secure sessions.
- 📧 **Email Functionality**: Use Nodemailer for password reset emails.
- 📊 **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks associated with users.
- 🔍 **Search and Filter**: Enable querying tasks by various parameters like status and priority.
- ⚙️ **Middleware**: Create custom middleware for error handling and authentication.
- 🌐 **Deployment Ready**: Prepare API for deployment with environment configurations.

## Key Insights
- ⚙️ **Type Safety with TypeScript**: Leveraging TypeScript ensures better code validation and error handling during development, enhancing maintainability and reducing runtime errors.
- 🔒 **Security and Authentication**: Implementing JWT for authentication adds a layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify resources.
- 📧 **Nodemailer for User Engagement**: Integrating email functionalities keeps users informed, particularly for critical actions like password resets, enhancing user experience and engagement.
- 📊 **Dynamic Task Management**: The ability to create, update, and delete tasks dynamically allows users to manage their workflow effectively, promoting productivity.
- 🔍 **Advanced Querying Capabilities**: Implementing search and filter functionalities helps users quickly find relevant tasks, improving usability and efficiency.
- 🛠️ **Middleware Importance**: Custom middleware for error handling and authentication streamlines the API’s functionality, making it easier to manage errors and secure endpoints.
- 🌐 **Deployment Considerations**: Preparing the API for deployment ensures that the application is robust and can handle production-level traffic while maintaining performance and security.
